projects and motifs<BR>
edbrowse - the command line browser project<BR>
empire logistics - visualizing port-pairs on a map, and adding landside car location messages<BR>
the "supply-chain infrastructure map" originally developed by Amiri using postgis, leaflet, tilestache, etc.<BR>
the great Giannina Segnini and her use of shipping databases for the cocaine-smuggled-in-shark-fin article, and other stories<BR>
the great Tom Slee, who scraped data from the airbnb site and showed, with Murray Cox, that airbnb lied through their teeth<BR>
Lux Leaks - Consortium of Investigative Journalists' great work<BR>
Maplight<BR>
Pro Publica<BR>
Muckraking Big Data evangelists<BR>
Muckraking the Sharing Economy<BR>
Don't take its spokesmen and ringmasters on their own terms<BR>
And bring 1099 out of the memory hole - 1099 in drayage, 1099 in messengers & couriers, 1099 from new tech startups is<BR>
all the same song and dance.  Mobile devices are just the latest excuse to claim we're in Year Zero and the old rules don't apply.<BR>

I am pursuing a certification in a damn buzzword with the initials D.S., from an acclaimed university with the initials J.H.,<BR>

I feel dirty.<BR>
You can just smell the commons being disrupted when you log into their thing.<BR>
Maybe it's a mistake to even use it in the first place.<BR>
As Phil Mirowski said, Facebook is training wheels that teaches you to be a neoliberal agent, and I feel the same about Coursera<BR>
And the instructors are bringing up quotes in their lectures by people like Ronald Coase.<BR>
Anyway, learning some "R" overlaps with what I do anyhow, so it may be a valuable kind of thing.<BR><BR>
