projects and motifs<BR>
edbrowse - the command line browser project<BR>
empire logistics - visualizing port-pairs on a map, and adding landside car location messages<BR>
the "supply-chain infrastructure map" originally developed by Amiri using postgis, leaflet, tilestache, etc.<BR>
the great Giannina Segnini and her use of shipping databases for the cocaine-smuggled-in-shark-fin article, and other stories<BR>
the great Tom Slee, who scraped data from the airbnb site and showed, with Murray Cox, that airbnb lied through their teeth<BR>
Lux Leaks - Consortium of Investigative Journalists' great work<BR>
Maplight<BR>
Pro Publica<BR>
maybe pursuing a certification in a damn buzzword with the initials D.S. in the form of a neoliberal and privatized MOOC by faculty from a school with the initials J.H.<BR>

Muckrake Big Data, muckrake the Sharing Economy- don't take its spokesmen and ringmasters on their own terms<BR>
And bring 1099 out of the memory hole - 1099 in drayage, 1099 in messengers & couriers, 1099 from new tech startups is<BR>
